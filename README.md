# IAT-Hook: Learning Windows PE through Import Address Table Hooking

I started this project in order to learn more about the PE format (windows executable format).

Here is a little proof of concept of a DLL hooking the MessageBoxA function that is loaded in the USER32.DLL module.

I hope some people can learn from it, if you have some questions feel free to contact me on LinkedIn.
